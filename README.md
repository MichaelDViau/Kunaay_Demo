# Kunaay Real Estate Platform

Kunaay Real Estate curates vacation rentals and property sales throughout the Riviera Maya. This repository now includes a lightweight Python backend plus an admin panel so non-technical collaborators can publish listings without touching code.

## Highlights

- **Dynamic listings** ‚Äì Rental and sale cards on `index.html`, `rentals.html`, and `sales.html` are rendered from live listing data served by the backend.
- **Auto-generated detail pages** ‚Äì Each property has a permalink at `listing.html?slug=<listing-slug>` with long-form descriptions and image galleries.
- **Browser-based admin panel** ‚Äì Visit `/admin` to log in, add listings (with photo uploads), and remove outdated entries instantly.
- **Zero external dependencies** ‚Äì The backend runs entirely on the Python standard library and SQLite, making local development straightforward even in restricted environments.

## Quick start on macOS with VS Code

### Super simple walkthrough

Follow these seven short steps the first time you open the project:

1. **Install Python 3 (only once).**
   - Open the Terminal app and type `python3 --version`.
   - If you see a version number, you already have it. If you see an error, download Python from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or install with Homebrew: `brew install python`.

2. **Open the folder in VS Code.**
   - Start VS Code, click **File ‚Üí Open Folder‚Ä¶**, and pick the project folder you downloaded.

3. **Show the terminal inside VS Code.**
   - Click **View ‚Üí Terminal**. A little command window opens at the bottom.

4. **Copy the example settings file.**
   - In that terminal, type `cp .env.example .env` and press Enter. This gives the server a username and password to use.

5. **(Optional) Make a virtual environment.**
   - If you want to keep things tidy, run:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv .venv
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - You can skip this step for a quick test.

6. **Start the website.**
   - Type `python3 server.py` and press Enter. Leave this window alone; it keeps running the site at `http://localhost:8000`.
   - If the terminal says the address is already in use, try `python3 server.py --port 8001` instead.

7. **Look at the site and admin panel.**
   - Open your web browser (Safari, Chrome, etc.) and visit `http://localhost:8000/` to see the listings.
   - Go to `http://localhost:8000/admin`, log in with username `admin` and password `admin123` (unless you changed them in `.env`), and try adding or removing a listing.

> üí° If VS Code says `python3: command not found`, Python is still missing. Install it, then completely close VS Code and open it again so it notices the new command.

## Getting started on other platforms

1. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   - Windows PowerShell: `py -m venv .venv` followed by `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

2. **Configure credentials:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (and `ADMIN_USERNAME` if needed).
   - The default credentials are `admin` / `admin123` for first run.

3. **Launch the backend server:**
   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```
   - Windows: `py server.py`
   The server starts on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). Static pages and API endpoints are available from the same origin.

   > üí° If your terminal reports `python: command not found`, use `python3` (macOS/Linux) or `py` (Windows). Many modern systems ship only the `python3` alias by default.

   > üí° Port busy? Run `python3 server.py --port 8001` (or another free number) to avoid conflicts with other apps.

4. **Seed data:**
   - On first run the database is created automatically with two sample listings (one rental and one sale) so the site has content immediately.

## Troubleshooting

- **‚ÄúAddress already in use‚Äù or the server closes immediately.** Another program is already using the port (often 8000). Run `python3 server.py --port 8001` or stop the conflicting program first.
- **Still seeing `python3: command not found`.** Ensure Python 3 is installed and that you‚Äôre running the command inside VS Code‚Äôs terminal (View ‚Üí Terminal) while the project folder is open.
- **Pages look blank.** Confirm the backend terminal is still running‚Äîif it stopped, restart it with `python3 server.py`.

## Admin workflow

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/admin`.
2. Sign in with the admin credentials.
3. Use the **Add a new listing** form to set the title, category, short summary, full description, and optional photo uploads. Supported categories are `rental` and `sale`.
4. Click **Create listing** ‚Äì the property appears instantly on the homepage, category page, and gains its own detail page.
5. Use the **Delete** action to retire listings; all associated uploads are removed from disk.

## Front-end behavior

- The homepage shows featured rentals and sales by requesting `/api/listings?type=rental&limit=3` and `/api/listings?type=sale&limit=3`.
- `rentals.html` and `sales.html` request all listings of their respective categories.
- `listing.html` reads a `slug` query parameter and fetches `/api/listings/<slug>` to populate the detail view.

## API summary

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/api/listings` | `GET` | Returns all listings (filter with `type` and `limit` query parameters). |
| `/api/listings/<slug>` | `GET` | Returns a single listing with image paths. |
| `/api/login` | `POST` | Authenticates an admin user. |
| `/api/logout` | `POST` | Ends the current admin session. |
| `/api/admin/listings` | `GET` | Returns all listings (auth required). |
| `/api/admin/listings` | `POST` | Creates a listing from `multipart/form-data` (auth required). |
| `/api/admin/listings/<id>/delete` | `POST` | Deletes a listing and its uploads (auth required). |

Session cookies are HTTP-only and expire after eight hours of inactivity.

## Data storage

- SQLite database file: `data/app.db` (ignored by Git).
- Uploaded images: `uploads/` (ignored by Git).
- Seeded assets reference existing photos in `assets/img/photos/`.

## Security notes

- Always update the default admin password before deploying.
- Serve the application behind HTTPS in production for secure credential transmission.
- Consider rotating session secrets and enhancing password policies before going live.
